echo HIPS Self-Protection Features Overview:
echo.

echo 1. Process Self-Protection
echo    - Prevents unauthorized termination of HIPS processes
echo    - Blocks code injection attempts into HIPS processes  
echo    - Prevents debugging and reverse engineering
echo    - Detects and blocks process hollowing attempts
echo.

echo 2. File System Self-Protection
echo    - Protects HIPS executable files from modification
echo    - Secures configuration files from tampering
echo    - Monitors critical HIPS directories
echo    - Verifies code signing and file integrity
echo    Protected Files:
echo      * hips.exe, HipsGui.exe, HipsDriver.sys
echo      * hips_config.json, protection_rules.json
echo      * C:\Program Files\HIPS\*
echo.

echo 3. Registry Self-Protection
echo    - Protects HIPS service registry keys
echo    - Monitors startup and configuration entries
echo    - Prevents unauthorized service modifications
echo    Protected Registry Keys:
echo      * HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\HipsDriver
echo      * HKLM\SOFTWARE\HIPS
echo.

echo 4. Memory Self-Protection
echo    - Prevents memory injection into HIPS processes
echo    - Blocks DLL injection and process hollowing
echo    - Detects memory manipulation attempts
echo    - Uses Windows process mitigation policies
echo.

echo 5. Service Self-Protection
echo    - Prevents unauthorized stopping of HIPS services
echo    - Monitors service control manager operations
echo    - Protects service configuration and dependencies
echo    Protected Services:
echo      * HipsDriver (kernel driver service)
echo      * HipsService (user-mode service)
echo.

echo 6. Anti-Debug Protection
echo    - Prevents attachment of debuggers to HIPS processes
echo    - Detects debugging attempts and responds accordingly
echo    - Uses advanced Windows security features
echo    - Blocks reverse engineering tools
echo.

echo 7. Integrity Verification
echo    - Verifies code signing of HIPS components
echo    - Performs file hash validation
echo    - Checks process integrity periodically
echo    - Validates service configurations
echo.

echo 8. Configurable Response Actions
echo    - Block and Alert: Stop the attack and notify administrators
echo    - Alert Only: Log the attempt for analysis
echo    - Block Silently: Stop the attack without notification
echo    - Terminate Attacker: End the attacking process
echo    - Quarantine Attacker: Isolate the malicious process/file
echo.

echo 9. Trusted Process Whitelist
echo    - Allows legitimate system processes to interact with HIPS
echo    - Configurable list of trusted processes
echo    Default Trusted Processes:
echo      * services.exe, winlogon.exe, csrss.exe
echo      * lsass.exe, svchost.exe
echo.

echo 10. Event Integration
echo     - Self-protection events integrate with main HIPS monitoring
echo     - Centralized logging and alerting
echo     - Real-time statistics and reporting
echo     - Integration with existing security rules engine
echo.

echo Configuration File: hips\config\hips_config_with_self_protection.json
echo Build Location: hips\build\
echo Documentation: HIPS_GUIDE.md (updated with self-protection info)
echo.

echo To test self-protection features:
echo 1. Build HIPS system: cd hips && build.bat
echo 2. Run as Administrator: cd build\Release && hips.exe
echo 3. Enable self-protection in configuration
echo 4. Try to terminate HIPS process (should be blocked)
echo 5. Monitor self-protection events in real-time
echo.

echo Self-Protection Rule Examples:
echo - Process Termination Protection: BLOCK_AND_ALERT on termination attempts
echo - File Tampering Protection: DENY on HIPS file modifications
echo - Registry Tampering Protection: BLOCK_AND_ALERT on registry changes
echo - Debug Protection: TERMINATE_ATTACKER on debugging attempts
echo - Memory Injection Protection: DENY on injection attempts
echo.

echo Enterprise Self-Protection Features:
echo - Similar to ESET, Kaspersky, and other commercial solutions
echo - Kernel-level protection that cannot be easily bypassed
echo - Comprehensive coverage of attack vectors
echo - Configurable policies for different environments
echo - Integration with existing security infrastructure
echo - Performance-optimized with minimal system impact
echo.
