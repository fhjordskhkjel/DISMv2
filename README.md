## Advanced HIPS (Host Intrusion Prevention System)

**üö® Enterprise-Grade Windows Security Solution**

The Advanced HIPS system is a comprehensive Windows-only Host Intrusion Prevention System designed for enterprise environments. It provides real-time monitoring and protection against advanced threats and intrusions.

### üõ°Ô∏è Core Protection Features
- **Real-time File System Monitoring**: Monitor file access, modifications, and deletions
- **Advanced Process Monitoring**: Detect suspicious process behavior and injection attempts  
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Monitor network connections and detect suspicious activity
- **Registry Protection**: Protect critical registry keys from unauthorized modifications
- **Memory Protection**: Prevent memory injection and exploit attempts
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Detect advanced persistent threats and zero-day exploits

### üéØ Key Advantages
- **Windows-Native**: Built specifically for Windows using Win32 APIs
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Designed for large-scale deployments with centralized management
- **Highly Customizable**: Flexible rule engine for custom security policies
- **Performance Optimized**: Minimal system impact with intelligent filtering
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Enterprise-level test suite ensuring reliability

### üìÅ HIPS Documentation
The complete HIPS documentation is located in [hips/docs/README.md](hips/docs/README.md).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Windows 7 or later (Windows 10/11 recommended)
- Administrator privileges for installation and operation
- Visual Studio 2019 or later / MinGW-w64 for compilation
- CMake 3.15 or later

### Building from Source

```bash
# Navigate to HIPS directory
cd hips

# Windows build using provided script
build.bat

# Manual build using CMake
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release

# Run tests
ctest -C Release
```

### Installation

1. Build the project using instructions above
2. Run `hips.exe` as Administrator
3. Configure using `config/hips_config.json`

## Architecture

The HIPS system is built with a modular architecture consisting of:

### Core Components
- **HIPSEngine**: Central orchestration and event processing
- **FileSystemMonitor**: File system activity monitoring
- **ProcessMonitor**: Process lifecycle and behavior monitoring
- **NetworkMonitor**: Network traffic and connection monitoring
- **RegistryMonitor**: Windows registry modification monitoring
- **MemoryProtector**: Memory injection and exploit protection

### Support Components
- **ConfigManager**: Configuration management and persistence
- **LogManager**: Comprehensive logging and audit trails
- **AlertManager**: Alert generation and notification system

## Configuration

The HIPS system is configured through `hips/config/hips_config.json`. Key configuration areas include:

- **Monitoring Rules**: Define what activities to monitor
- **Alert Thresholds**: Set sensitivity levels for different threat types
- **Response Actions**: Configure automatic response to detected threats
- **Logging Levels**: Control detail level of audit logs
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize system impact

## Usage

### Starting the HIPS System

```bash
# Start HIPS monitoring (requires Administrator privileges)
cd hips/build/Release
hips.exe
```

### Managing Rules

The HIPS system supports dynamic rule management through its API:

```cpp
// Add a custom security rule
SecurityRule rule;
rule.name = "Block Suspicious Process";
rule.event_type = EventType::PROCESS_CREATION;
rule.action = ActionType::DENY;
rule.pattern = "suspicious.exe";
hips_engine.AddRule(rule);
```

## Security Considerations

### Deployment Security

1. **Privilege Management**: Run with minimal required privileges
2. **Configuration Protection**: Protect configuration files from tampering
3. **Log Security**: Secure log files and transmission
4. **Update Management**: Implement secure update mechanisms

### Threat Model

The HIPS system protects against:

- Malware execution and persistence
- Unauthorized file system modifications
- Process injection and privilege escalation
- Network-based attacks and data exfiltration
- Registry-based persistence mechanisms

## Performance Considerations

The HIPS system is designed for minimal performance impact:

- **Intelligent Filtering**: Only monitor relevant events
- **Optimized Callbacks**: Fast event processing
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup and memory management
- **Configurable Sensitivity**: Adjust monitoring levels based on needs
