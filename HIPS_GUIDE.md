# Advanced HIPS Implementation Guide

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) designed for Windows enterprise environments. The HIPS system provides real-time monitoring and protection against advanced threats.

## Quick Start

### Windows Build (Recommended)
```batch
cd hips
build.bat
```

### Manual Build
```bash
cd hips
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Running the System
```bash
# Run as Administrator (required for full functionality)
cd hips/build/Release
hips.exe
```

## Core Components

### 1. HIPSEngine (src/hips_core.cpp)
- Central orchestration and event processing
- Rule engine for security policy enforcement
- Event handler registration and management
- Statistics tracking and reporting

### 2. File System Monitor (src/file_monitor.cpp)
- Real-time file system monitoring using Windows APIs
- Configurable watch paths and extensions
- File access, modification, and deletion detection
- Intelligent filtering to reduce false positives

### 3. Process Monitor (src/process_monitor.cpp)
- Process creation and termination monitoring
- Memory usage tracking and threshold enforcement
- Suspicious process pattern detection
- Parent-child process relationship tracking

### 4. Network Monitor (src/network_monitor.cpp)
- TCP/UDP connection monitoring
- Suspicious port detection
- Outbound connection tracking
- Network traffic analysis

### 5. Registry Monitor (src/registry_monitor.cpp)
- Windows registry modification monitoring
- Critical registry key protection
- Startup persistence detection
- Service modification tracking

### 6. Memory Protector (src/memory_protector.cpp)
- DLL injection detection
- Process hollowing prevention
- Heap spraying detection
- ROP chain prevention

## Configuration

The system is configured through `hips/config/hips_config.json`:

### Key Settings:
- **Monitoring Intervals**: Control scan frequency for performance
- **Watch Paths**: Define which directories to monitor
- **Threat Thresholds**: Set sensitivity levels
- **Response Actions**: Configure automatic responses
- **Performance Limits**: Manage system resource usage

### Security Rules:
- Pattern-based event matching
- Threat level classification
- Configurable actions (ALLOW, DENY, QUARANTINE, ALERT_ONLY)
- Custom metadata for rule categorization

## Enterprise Features

### Central Management
- Remote configuration management
- Centralized reporting and alerting
- Policy enforcement capabilities
- Automatic update mechanisms

### Performance Optimization
- Intelligent event filtering
- Resource usage monitoring
- Automatic throttling under high load
- Configurable performance limits

### Compliance and Auditing
- Comprehensive event logging
- Audit trail generation
- Compliance reporting
- Forensic data collection

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive unit tests:

```bash
cd hips/build
ctest -C Release
```

### Test Coverage:
- Core engine functionality
- Component initialization and lifecycle
- Event processing and rule evaluation
- Configuration management
- Stress testing and performance validation

## Security Considerations

### Privileges
- Requires Administrator privileges for full functionality
- Uses minimal necessary Windows API permissions
- Protects own process from tampering

### Performance Impact
- Designed for minimal system impact (<10% CPU, <200MB RAM)
- Intelligent filtering reduces event volume
- Configurable monitoring intervals
- Automatic performance throttling

### Threat Protection
- Zero-day exploit detection through behavioral analysis
- Advanced persistent threat (APT) detection
- Memory-based attack prevention
- Fileless malware detection

## Deployment

### Single System
1. Build the HIPS system
2. Configure monitoring rules
3. Run as Administrator
4. Monitor logs and alerts

### Enterprise Environment
1. Configure central management server
2. Deploy to target systems
3. Configure enterprise policies
4. Monitor through central console

## Support and Documentation

- Complete API documentation in `hips/docs/README.md`
- Configuration examples in `hips/config/`
- Test cases demonstrate expected behavior

## Architecture Benefits

### Modular Design
- Independent monitoring components
- Pluggable rule engine
- Configurable response actions
- Extensible architecture

### Windows Native
- Uses Windows APIs directly
- Optimized for Windows environments
- Integrates with Windows security features
- Minimal external dependencies

### Enterprise Ready
- Scalable to large deployments
- Centralized management capabilities
- Performance monitoring and tuning
- Comprehensive logging and reporting

This HIPS implementation provides enterprise-grade security monitoring with minimal performance impact, making it suitable for large-scale Windows deployments.
