- Event-driven architecture with real-time monitoring
- Integration with existing HIPS security rules engine

### 2. Enhanced HIPSEngine Integration
- Added self-protection management methods to main HIPS engine
- Automatic initialization and lifecycle management
- Statistics and monitoring integration
- Event flow integration with existing security event processing

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/test_self_protection.cpp`)
- Unit tests for all self-protection functionality
- Integration tests with main HIPS engine
- Configuration and rule management tests
- Event handling and statistics validation

### 4. Configuration Support
- JSON configuration file with self-protection settings
- Configurable protection levels and response actions
- Trusted process whitelist management
- Integration with existing HIPS configuration system

## Protection Mechanisms Implemented

### Process Protection
- **Anti-Termination**: Prevents unauthorized termination of HIPS processes
- **Anti-Injection**: Blocks code injection attempts (DLL injection, process hollowing)
- **Anti-Debug**: Prevents debugging and reverse engineering attempts
- **Process Mitigation**: Uses Windows security features (DEP, ASLR, etc.)

### File System Protection
- **Binary Protection**: Protects HIPS executable files from modification
- **Configuration Protection**: Secures configuration and rule files
- **Directory Monitoring**: Monitors critical HIPS installation directories
- **Integrity Verification**: Code signing and hash validation

### Registry Protection
- **Service Key Protection**: Protects HIPS service registry entries
- **Configuration Protection**: Secures HIPS registry configuration
- **Startup Protection**: Monitors auto-start registry locations
- **Modification Detection**: Real-time registry change monitoring

### Memory Protection
- **Code Injection Prevention**: Blocks memory-based attacks
- **Memory Manipulation Detection**: Detects unauthorized memory changes
- **Heap Protection**: Prevents heap spraying and corruption
- **ROP/JOP Protection**: Uses Windows CFG and other mitigations

### Service Protection
- **Service Control Protection**: Prevents unauthorized service stopping
- **Dependency Protection**: Monitors service dependencies
- **Configuration Protection**: Secures service configuration
- **SCM Monitoring**: Monitors Service Control Manager operations

## Security Features

### Anti-Tampering Mechanisms
- **Code Signing Verification**: Validates digital signatures of HIPS components
- **File Integrity Checking**: Hash-based file integrity verification
- **Process Integrity Validation**: Runtime process integrity checks
- **Configuration Validation**: Ensures configuration file integrity

### Response Actions
- **Block and Alert**: Stop attack and generate security event
- **Alert Only**: Log attack for analysis without blocking
- **Block Silently**: Stop attack without generating alerts
- **Terminate Attacker**: End the attacking process
- **Quarantine Attacker**: Isolate malicious process or file

### Trusted Process Management
- **Whitelist System**: Configurable list of trusted processes
- **System Process Recognition**: Built-in trust for critical system processes
- **Dynamic Trust Assessment**: Runtime evaluation of process trustworthiness
- **Certificate-Based Trust**: Trust based on code signing certificates

## Integration Points

### Event System Integration
- Self-protection events flow through existing HIPS event processing
- Unified logging and alerting system
- Real-time statistics and monitoring
- Integration with security rules engine

### Configuration Integration
- JSON-based configuration with self-protection settings

- Configuration management interface
- Attack detection and response visualization

## Performance Considerations

### Minimal System Impact
- Intelligent event filtering to reduce overhead
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations
- Configurable monitoring intervals

### Scalability
- Thread-safe implementation for multi-core systems
- Efficient data structures for high-volume environments
- Configurable resource limits and throttling
- Enterprise-scale performance optimization

## Enterprise Features

### Centralized Management Ready
- Configuration API for remote management
- Event forwarding for SIEM integration
- Policy templates for different environments
- Compliance reporting capabilities

### Threat Intelligence Integration
- Event correlation with threat intelligence feeds
- Signature-based detection capabilities

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```cpp
// Initialize and start self-protection
auto hips = std::make_unique<HIPSEngine>();
hips->Initialize();
hips->EnableSelfProtection(true);
hips->Start();

// Check protection status
bool protected = hips->IsSelfProtectionEnabled();
bool integrity = hips->CheckSelfIntegrity();

// Get statistics
uint64_t events = hips->GetSelfProtectionEventCount();
uint64_t blocked = hips->GetBlockedAttacksCount();
```

### Configuration
```json
{
  "self_protection": {
    "enabled": true,
    "process_protection": { "enabled": true },
    "file_protection": { "enabled": true },
    "registry_protection": { "enabled": true },
    "memory_protection": { "enabled": true },
    "response_settings": {
      "auto_quarantine_attackers": false,
      "terminate_attacking_process": false,
      "block_and_alert": true
    }
  }
}
```
