build.bat

# Manual build using CMake
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
cmake --build . --config Release

# Run tests
ctest -C Release
```

#### Option 3: Using Visual Studio 2022 IDE
```batch
# Open the solution file
AdvancedHIPS.sln

# Build the entire solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
# Or build individual projects:
# - HipsUserMode: User-mode application
# - HipsDriver: Kernel-mode driver
```

### Installation

#### Kernel Driver Installation (Required for Full Protection)
1. **Enable Test Signing** (for development/testing):
   ```batch
   # Run as Administrator
   bcdedit /set testsigning on
   # Reboot required
   ```

2. **Install the Kernel Driver**:
   ```batch
   # Navigate to driver output directory
   cd hips\bin\x64\Release
   
   # Install using PnP utility
   pnputil /add-driver HipsDriver.inf /install
   
   # Or right-click HipsDriver.inf and select "Install"
   ```

3. **Start the Driver Service**:
   ```batch
   # Start the driver
   sc start HipsDriver
   
   # Verify driver is running
   sc query HipsDriver
   ```

#### GUI Configuration Tool (NEW!)

The HIPS system now includes a modern MFC-based GUI application built with Visual C++:

**Features:**
- **Real-time Driver Status**: Monitor connection and operational status
- **Event Monitoring**: View security events in real-time with detailed information
- **Driver Control**: Start/stop monitoring, connect/disconnect from kernel driver
- **Activity Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all system activities
- **Configuration Management**: Easy-to-use interface for system settings

**Using the GUI:**
1. Build the GUI project in Visual Studio 2022:
   ```batch
   cd hips\gui_vcpp
   msbuild HipsGui.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
   ```

2. Launch the application:
   ```batch
   HipsGui.exe
   ```

3. Connect to the driver and start monitoring through the intuitive interface

#### User-Mode Application
1. Build the project using instructions above
2. Run `hips.exe` as Administrator
3. Configure using `config/hips_config.json` or the new **GUI Configuration Tool**

**GUI Configuration Tool (NEW!):**
```batch
# Navigate to GUI directory
cd hips\gui

# Build and run the configuration tool
dotnet build --configuration Release
dotnet run
```

**Note**: For production deployment, obtain a valid code signing certificate and sign the driver.

## Architecture

The HIPS system is built with a hybrid architecture consisting of both user-mode and kernel-mode components:

### Kernel-Mode Components (NEW!)
- **HipsDriver**: Minifilter driver providing kernel-level monitoring
  - **File System Monitor**: Real-time file operations monitoring via minifilter
  - **Process Monitor**: Process creation/termination callbacks
  - **Registry Monitor**: Registry modification monitoring
  - **Rule Engine**: Real-time security rule evaluation and blocking
  - **Event Manager**: Secure kernel-to-user event communication

### User-Mode Components
- **HIPSEngine**: Central orchestration and event processing
- **FileSystemMonitor**: Enhanced file system activity monitoring
- **ProcessMonitor**: Process lifecycle and behavior monitoring  
- **NetworkMonitor**: Network traffic and connection monitoring
- **RegistryMonitor**: Enhanced Windows registry modification monitoring
- **MemoryProtector**: Memory injection and exploit protection

### Support Components
- **ConfigManager**: Configuration management and persistence
- **LogManager**: Comprehensive logging and audit trails
- **AlertManager**: Alert generation and notification system

## Configuration

The HIPS system is configured through `hips/config/hips_config.json`. Key configuration areas include:

- **Monitoring Rules**: Define what activities to monitor
- **Alert Thresholds**: Set sensitivity levels for different threat types
- **Response Actions**: Configure automatic response to detected threats
- **Logging Levels**: Control detail level of audit logs
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize system impact

## Usage

### Starting the HIPS System

```bash
# Start HIPS monitoring (requires Administrator privileges)
cd hips/build/Release
hips.exe
```

### Managing Rules

The HIPS system supports dynamic rule management through its API:

```cpp
// Add a custom security rule
SecurityRule rule;
rule.name = "Block Suspicious Process";
rule.event_type = EventType::PROCESS_CREATION;
rule.action = ActionType::DENY;
rule.pattern = "suspicious.exe";
hips_engine.AddRule(rule);
```

## Security Considerations

### Deployment Security

1. **Privilege Management**: Run with minimal required privileges
2. **Configuration Protection**: Protect configuration files from tampering
3. **Log Security**: Secure log files and transmission
4. **Update Management**: Implement secure update mechanisms

### Threat Model

The HIPS system protects against:

- Malware execution and persistence
- Unauthorized file system modifications
- Process injection and privilege escalation
- Network-based attacks and data exfiltration
- Registry-based persistence mechanisms

## Performance Considerations

The HIPS system is designed for minimal performance impact:

- **Intelligent Filtering**: Only monitor relevant events
- **Optimized Callbacks**: Fast event processing
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup and memory management
- **Configurable Sensitivity**: Adjust monitoring levels based on needs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Driver Installation Issues
- **Problem**: Driver fails to install with "Driver is not digitally signed" error
- **Solution**: Enable test signing mode or obtain a valid code signing certificate
  ```batch
  # Enable test signing (requires reboot)
  bcdedit /set testsigning on
  ```

#### Driver Won't Start
- **Problem**: `sc start HipsDriver` returns error
- **Solutions**:
  1. Check if driver is properly installed: `sc query HipsDriver`
  2. Verify kernel driver files are in correct location
  3. Check Event Viewer for detailed error messages
  4. Ensure running as Administrator

#### BSOD or System Instability
- **Problem**: Blue Screen of Death when driver is loaded
- **Prevention**: Enhanced driver stability implemented with:
  - Comprehensive buffer validation
  - Exception handling around user buffer access
  - Memory leak prevention
  - Proper IRQL level management
- **Solution**: Boot in safe mode and remove driver if issues persist

#### High CPU Usage
- **Problem**: HIPS system consuming too much CPU
- **Solutions**:
  1. Adjust scan intervals in configuration
  2. Exclude non-critical file extensions
  3. Reduce monitoring scope in `hips_config.json`

#### Configuration Not Applied
- **Problem**: Changes to configuration file not taking effect
- **Solutions**:
  1. Restart HIPS service after configuration changes
  2. Verify JSON syntax is valid
  3. Check file permissions on configuration file
  4. Use the new **HIPS Configuration Tool** for easier management:
     ```bash
     cd hips/gui
     dotnet run --configuration Release
     ```

### HIPS Configuration Tool Features
The new configuration tool provides:
- **Interactive Menu System**: Easy navigation through configuration options
